# SoSu Studio Documentation

This documentation will showcase future and current SoSu Studio Projects. You can think of it as a mock webpage for the studio.
SoSu Studio is game development and software studio. The name was changed from Tribes Studio to SoSu Studio. Updates will be made in
the application and on this repository README to display the stuidos software capabilities and technical computational ideologies. The workspace station
will be used as way to coop and share ideas with other developers for creative strategies.
